Both flew over Japan&#8217;s southern Okinawa region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this month inspected the country&#8217;s first military spy satellite as it was prepared for launch, and gave the green light for its &#8220;future action plan&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Kim had identified the development of such satellites as a key defence project for the North Korean military.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because long-range rockets and space launchers share the same technology, analysts say developing the ability to put a satellite in orbit would provide Pyongyang with cover for testing banned intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan&#8217;s defence ministry issued an order to shoot down any ballistic missile confirmed to be on course to fall into its territory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korea&#8217;s foreign ministry condemned the launch plan, but officials did not confirm to AFP if Seoul had been directly notified too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;North Korea&#8217;s so-called &#8216;satellite launch&#8217; is a serious violation of UN Security Council resolutions banning all launches using ballistic missile technology, and is a clearly illegal act that cannot be justified under any pretext,&#8221; the ministry said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>South Korea and Japan have been working to mend long-frayed ties, including with greater cooperation on North Korea&#8217;s military threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unusual stance<br>Meanwhile, Kishida on Monday reiterated that Tokyo is open to talks with Pyongyang.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>North Korean state media on Monday published a statement from the country&#8217;s vice-minister of foreign affairs, appearing to endorse a conciliatory approach to relations with Japan &#8212; an unusual stance from Pyongyang.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Japan avoids &#8220;being shackled by the past, and seeks a way out for improving the relations, there is no reason for the DPRK and Japan not to meet&#8221;, said the statement from Pak Sang Gil, using the initials of North Korea&#8217;s official name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pak said, however, that Japan needs to move on from sticking points such as the &#8220;abduction issue&#8221; for ties to improve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan suspects dozens of people who are still missing were abducted by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies in the Japanese language and culture.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>North Korea has informed Japan that is preparing to launch a satellite as early as this week, Tokyo announced Monday but warned it may actually be a sanctions-defying ballistic missile test.
