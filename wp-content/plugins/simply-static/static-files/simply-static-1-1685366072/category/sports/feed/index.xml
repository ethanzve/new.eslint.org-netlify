<p>Paris Saint-Germain back-up goalkeeper Sergio Rico is in &#8220;serious&#8221; condition after a horse-riding accident, the French club confirmed Sunday.</p>



<p>The 29-year-old Spaniard was on the bench for PSG as they won the Ligue 1 title on Saturday with a 1-1 draw at Strasbourg before heading to Spain, where the accident happened in El Rocio in Andalusia.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is in serious condition,&#8221; said a PSG spokesperson, while Spanish newspaper Marca report he is &#8220;stable&#8221;.</p>



<p>Rico was taken by helicopter to Seville&#8217;s Virgen del Rocio hospital, where he was placed on life support, according to local TV channel Canal Sur, citing medical sources.<br>&#8220;Lots of strength and a speedy recovery,&#8221; wrote Sevilla, whom he played for previously, on Twitter.</p>



<p>PSG tweeted their support for Rico and said they were &#8220;staying in contact with his family. The entire Red and Blue community offer them their support.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rico, born in Seville, won two Europa Leagues with his hometown side before moving on loan to Premier League side Fulham in 2019.</p>



<p>The goalkeeper then moved to PSG on loan in 2019 before making the move permanent in 2020.</p>



<p>Rico was loaned by the French side to Mallorca in January 2022, before returning to PSG for the current campaign.</p>



<p>He has made 24 appearances for PSG and has been capped once by the Spanish national team.</p>
